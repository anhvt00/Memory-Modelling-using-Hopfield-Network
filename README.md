# Memory-Modelling-using-Hopfield-Network

This project was part of the ISRC-CN3 Autumn School at the Intelligent Systems Research Centre (ISRC), School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systems, Ulster University, Derry~Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
In the project, I investigated the impact of the delay between pattern presentations on memory recall performance using the Hopfield neural network with the triple-well weight potential function.
